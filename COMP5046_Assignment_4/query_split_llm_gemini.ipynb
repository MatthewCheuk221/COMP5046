        "\n",
        "    ### SQL Generation Rules\n",
        "    1. Always use SELECT DISTINCT.\n",
        "    2. Do NOT use JOIN. Use comma-separated tables in the FROM clause, joined using WHERE conditions with parentheses.\n",
        "    3. Alias every table in the format: [TABLE] AS [TABLEaliasN], where N starts from 0 and increases for each table instance.\n",
        "    4. Always qualify fields with their table aliases (e.g., FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID).\n",
        "    5. Do NOT use SELECT *, GROUP BY, HAVING, LIMIT, or OFFSET.\n",
        "    6. Output the SQL as a single-line string — no line breaks or indentation.\n",
        "    7. Only use tables and fields from the schema listed below.\n",
        "    8. Include WHERE clause conditions for the tables with [TABLEaliasN] (where N > 0) in parentheses with the joining clauses.\n",
        "\n",
        "    ---\n",
        "\n",
        "    ### Additional SQL Features from Dataset\n",
        "    • Subqueries for MIN, MAX, or nested filtering\n",
        "    • IN (SELECT ...) for mappings (e.g., DAYS_CODE)\n",
        "    • OR logic for alternatives\n",
        "    • Indirect joins (e.g., CITY → AIRPORT_SERVICE → FLIGHT)\n",
        "    • Repeated use of same tables with increasing aliases\n",
        "    • Use of NOT, >=, < for filtering\n",
        "    • Outputs are mostly IDs or codes\n",
        "    • Always end SQL with a semicolon\n",
        "    • Always have a space before and after parentheses\n",
        "\n",
        "    ---\n",
        "\n",
        "    ### City-Based Query Rules\n",
        "    • Use CITY.CITY_NAME joined via AIRPORT_SERVICE and FLIGHT\n",
        "    • Use FLIGHT.FROM_AIRPORT and FLIGHT.TO_AIRPORT for route matching\n",
        "    • Ensure CITYalias0 refers to origin, CITYalias1 refers to destination\n",
        "    • Only include CITYalias1-based filters and FLIGHTalias0.TO_AIRPORT in the main parenthesis**\n",
        "    • Place CITYalias0-based filters and FLIGHTalias0.FROM_AIRPORT outside the parenthesis**\n",
        "    • Put TO_AIRPORT-based filtering (e.g., DEPARTURE_TIME) in CITYalias1 clause\n",
        "\n",
        "    ---\n",
        "\n",
        "    ### Fare and Round Trip Rules\n",
        "    • Use FARE, FLIGHT_FARE, and FLIGHT when the question asks about prices, tickets, costs, round trips, or arrangements\n",
        "    • For round trip queries, always include:\n",
        "        FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_COST IS NOT NULL AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID\n",

        "        FAREalias0.ROUND_TRIP_REQUIRED = \"NO\" AND FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FARE_ID = FAREalias0.FARE_ID AND FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID = FLIGHT_FAREalias0.FLIGHT_ID\n",
        "    • Do NOT use `ONE_DIRECTION_COST IS NOT NULL` to infer one-way flights because it is not correct.\n",
        "\n",
        "    ---\n",
        "\n",
        "    ### Date vs Time Handling\n",
        "    • Use DATE_DAY and DAYS only when the question is about days of the week or calendar dates (e.g., \"on Monday\", \"May 13th\")\n",
        "    • Do NOT use DATE_DAY and DAYS when the question is only about departure or arrival times (e.g., \"before 1000\")\n",
        "\n",
        "    ---\n",
        "\n",
        "    ### Time Filter Rules\n",
        "    • If the question mentions:\n",
        "        - “before <time>”: use FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME < [time]\n",
        "        - “after <time>”: use FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME > [time]\n",
        "        - “between <t1> and <t2>”: use FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= [t1] AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= [t2]\n",
        "        - “around <time>” or “about <time>”: use a window of ±30 minutes from the time:\n",
        "            FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME >= [time - 100] AND FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME <= [time + 100]\n",
        "    • Time filters should always go in the CITYalias1 (destination) clause.\n",
        "    • Use FLIGHTalias0.ARRIVAL_TIME if arrival is mentioned; otherwise, use FLIGHTalias0.DEPARTURE_TIME.\n",
        "\n",
        "    ---\n",
        "\n",
        "    ### Output Field Rule\n",
        "    • Unless the question explicitly asks for cost, times, or other fields, always output:\n",
        "        SELECT DISTINCT FLIGHTalias0.FLIGHT_ID\n",
